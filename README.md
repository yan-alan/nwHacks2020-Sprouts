# nwHacks 2020 - *Sprouts*

## Inspiration
Interaction with indoor plants can reduce physiological and psychological stress, based on previous psychological and neurological studies. In addition many people face a common issue of forgetting when to water their plants or how to take care of them. By creating a game-like app that helps users learn to care for their plants, the goal of this project was also to help reduce their stress levels.
