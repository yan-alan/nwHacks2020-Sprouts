## Inspiration
Interaction with indoor plants can reduce physiological and psychological stress, based on previous psychological and neurological studies. In addition many people face a common issue of forgetting when to water their plants or how to take care of them. By creating a game-like app that helps users learn to care for their plants, the goal of this project was also to help reduce their stress levels.

## About
Sprouts was built natively on iOS using Swift, with a custom back-end created with Node.js, Express, and mongoDB Atlas. The server is hosted on AmazonAWS EC2.
